            <h2 id="chola" class="text-center">Chana Masala</h2>
            <p>
                Another Indian recipe on MsM today! When I posted the recipe for Bhatura, a deep-fried leavened bread from the North of India, I promised I would also share the recipe for Chole Masala (also known as Chana Masala). This amazingly tasty chickpea curry is always served with Bhatura and together they make up a dish called “Chana Bhatura”. I have always liked chickpeas, so it’s not suprising that I absolutey adore this dish, but even my husband, who is usually a “meat-lover” kinda guy, puts on a big smile when he sees Chole Masala at the table! Besides, this curry is vegetarian, vegan and quite healthy too. You can find many recipes for chole on the internet, but I finally found THE version for me. You can take a shortcut and use canned chickpeas, going through the whole process ensures the best results.  By cooking the dried chickpeas with soda bicarbonate and tea makes them tender and gives them a nice dark colour too. Just make sure not to overcook them, or they will go mushy. Serve this amazingly tasty vegetarian curry with hot Bhature. Indian cuisine is delicious all year round, but it's especially perfect for cold weather. Enter this slow cooker chana masala. Made with warming spices and fresh ingredients, thisvegan recipeis the ideal antidote to the winter blahs. Even more importantly, it's made in with aslow-cooker, so you can set it and forget it as you go about your day... and then come back to a healthy and filling meal that won't leave you feeling weighed down. Read on to discover this slow cooker chana masala recipe perfect for seasonal eating.        </section>

            <h2 id="chicken" class="text-center">Chicken Masala</h2>
            <p>
                The origin of the dish is not certain, but many sources attribute it to the South Asian community in Great Britain.[2][5][6]

                Chicken tikka masala may derive from butter chicken, a popular dish in the northern Indian subcontinent. The Multicultural Handbook of Food, Nutrition and Dietetics credits its creation to Bangladeshi migrant chefs in the 1960s, after migrating to Britain from Bangladesh. At the time, these migrant chefs developed and served a number of new inauthentic "Indian" dishes, including chicken tikka masala.[7]
                
                Historians of ethnic food, Peter and Colleen Grove, discuss multiple origin-claims of chicken tikka masala, concluding that the dish "was most certainly invented in Britain, probably by a Bangladeshi chef."[8] They suggest that "the shape of things to come may have been a recipe for Shahi Chicken Masala in Mrs Balbir Singh’s Indian Cookery published in 1961."[8]
                
                Another explanation is that it originated in a restaurant in Glasgow, Scotland.[9][1] This version recounts how a chef, proprietor of a restaurant in Glasgow, invented chicken tikka masala by improvising a sauce made from a tin of condensed tomato soup, and spices.[10][11]
                
                Chef Anita Jaisinghani, a correspondent in the Houston Chronicle, wrote that "the most likely story is that the modern version was created during the early ’70s by an enterprising Indian chef near London" who used Campbell's tomato soup.[12] This is disputed by author Jo Monroe, who claims that this story was deliberately invented by the founder of a London restaurant "to entertain journalists".[13]
                
                Rahul Verma, a food critic who writes for The Hindu,[14] said he first tasted the dish in 1971 and that its origins were in Punjab, India. He said, "It's basically a Punjabi dish not more than 40–50 years old and must be an accidental discovery which has had periodical improvisations."        </section>

            <h2 id="pav" class="text-center">Pav Bhaji</h2>
            <p>
                Pav Bhaji has its origins in the civil war of America in the 1860s. Because of the civil war, there was a huge demand for cotton. Due to this, the traders at the Bombay cotton exchange used to be very busy especially during the night when new cotton rates used to be telegram from America. Thus they used to return home late and the annoyed wives would not serve them food. So to solve this problem the street vendors to collect the leftover bread from the Jesuit priests and mix all the vegetables, mash them together and used to eat them with the bread and butter. Thus pav(bread) bhaji(vegetables) was born.
                Thus from the humble beginnings, the street of Bombay to being a household item in the entire nation pav Bhaji has come a long way. While the story behind the origin of Bhaji is very common, the story behind the origin of Pav and its name is more like a folklore.
                According to one version, the bread is known as pav because you get it in a set of four and then you break off each mini loaf as you eat. The Pav means one-fourth in the Marathi language.
                The second version says that the art of making this kind of bread i.e. Pav was brought to India by Portuguese people. Before this, Indian people made only unleavened bread like chapattis. There is one more crazy story that says that the bread is called pav because the dough was kneaded using feet to speed up the work. Sounds like this was created by a hate of Pav Bhaji.        </section>
